# Project Specifications


Our task is to analyze a database, which shows student engagement with the 365 platform, and identify key areas of improvement. Keeping in mind the metrics that 365â€™s CEO might find useful, build a single-page dashboard or machine learning model. 

## Instructions

The main objective is to build a single-page dashboard with key metrics, insights, and visualizations on student engagement.

Start with defining the questions you would like to give answers to. Determine what visualization best fits a given query and how the information could be filtered. Then, create a rough sketch of the dashboard.


## Optional Instructions

You should define more than one question youâ€™d like to tackle with your dashboard. Compose a list of everything youâ€™d like to cover first, and then structure your design accordingly. Here are some examples of questions you may want to answer:

Which courses are the most watched by students? How are they rated?
How would you define engagement (examples could be onboarding, minutes watched on the platform, exams/quizzes taken, etc.)?
What key performance indicators (KPIs) are relevant to the problem?
How many students register each month? What fraction of these students are also onboarded?
Do students watch more content with time? Is this seasonally dependent? Does it depend on marketing campaigns, promo periods, etc.?
How do the students engage with the platform based on user type (free or paid), subscription type (monthly, quarterly, or annual), and country?
Which are the countries with the most students registered? Does this number scale proportionally with the number of minutes watched per country?
